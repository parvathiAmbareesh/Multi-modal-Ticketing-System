# Multi-Modal Ticketing System using Blockchain

This repo contains the source code to my Final Year Project for Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology under APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University

## Project Description
This Project introduces a Ticketing System for Multi-modal transportation, utilizing the Ethereum Blockchain.

The System primarily includes:

* Ticketing for multiple modes of transport in a single journey
* Fare Splitting System based on selected modes
* Secure Data Storage through Blockchain

## Procedure overview:

* User scans a QR code upon entry and exit of transportation
* On scanning the QR code, details such as starting location, time, date, and journey cost, are recorded in the blockchain
* Upon exit, the transportation fee is deducted from the user
* Optional verification check ensures consistency between blockchain values and calculated values in the application
